### Homework 1: Sorting
quick sort and insertion sort : given a sequence of number and sort them in two ways. 

### Homework 2: 2D-ranking
sort vertices on 2D plane.

### Homework 3: Shortest Path
Given the distance of each node and the road width, and find the shorest path.
The road width here stands for another restriction for find paths, since users must find the shorest path by the allowed transportation.
There are truck, car and bike, and each of the transportation has their car width. The car width should be larger than the road width or it can not passed.
Among these statement, we use Dijkstra's Algorithm to find an answer for this problem.
